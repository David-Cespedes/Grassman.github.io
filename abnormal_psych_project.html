    <p>To put it into shorter words; DID is basically a disorder where a person has multiple personalities, reason why it was earlier called Muliple Personality Disorder.</p>

      <li>Hypnotherapy (When hypnosis is used to access repressed memories, control some of the problematic behaviors, and to integrate all the personalities into one.)</li>
